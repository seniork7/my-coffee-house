## Project Overview

This website was originally created as a mid-term project for my first semester in the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College. The initial goal was to demonstrate basic HTML, CSS, and accessibility skills by building a modern, accessible, and visually engaging coffee shop website.

Over time, I have continued to build on and improve this project, restructuring the codebase and enhancing the design using Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com/). The site now features a responsive layout, modern UI components, and improved maintainability, while still reflecting the original learning objectives.

## Purpose

- To showcase my progress and skills in web development, from basic HTML/CSS to advanced utility first styling with Tailwind.
- To serve as a portfolio piece demonstrating accessible, responsive, and user friendly design.
- To provide a realistic, interactive website for a fictional coffee shop, including features like a menu, blog, contact form, and checkout/cart functionality.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility first styling)
- **JavaScript** (for interactivity, navigation, and cart functionality)
- **Font Awesome** (for icons (https://fontawesome.com/))
- **Animate.css** (for subtle animations (https://animate.style/))

- **Google Fonts** (Montserrat & Playfair for modern typography)

**Note:**  
This project continues to evolve as I learn new web development techniques and best practices. Future updates may include:

- Further design refinements and feature additions
- Enhanced accessibility compliance and testing
- Performance optimizations and code refactoring
- Integration of new technologies and tools as I expand my skill set
